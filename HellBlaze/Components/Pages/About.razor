        <h2>About This Tool</h2>
        <p>
            HellBlaze is a fan-made web application designed to help Helldivers inject some more fun back into their
            games.
            No more taking your favourites. No more only playing optimally! Try out some randomised loadouts that you'd
            never
            think of before.

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <h3>Weighting System</h3>
        <p>
            HellBlaze works by generating a randomised loadout based on JSON data that has been built specifically for
            this project.
            If you check out the <a href="/stratagems" class="link">Stratagems</a> or <a href="/weapons" class="link">Weapons</a>
            pages, you'll see that the data is
            represented over there.
        </p>
        <p>
            It uses a weighting system. So if we do not apply any multipliers then we'll have an equal chance for
            every stratagem to show up.
            If we add, say, a 5x multiplier for fire, then the randomiser will add the fire weight * fire multiplier to
            the total weight.
            This means that the fire stratagem will be more likely to show up.
        </p>
        <p>
            That weighting system will work with anything since it's all just based on the higher weights meaning
            something is more likely.
            This does mean that if you have a stratagem that is explosive, fire-based, and anti-tank then you add 5x
            multipliers for each, you will get that stratagem showing up a lot.
            This is intended behaviour and means that your loadout will reflect the sliders as closely as possible while
            remaining random :)
        </p>
        <MudDivider/>
        <h3>
            Base Weight
        </h3>
        <p>
            Note that a base weight is added as well. Remember that the higher a weight, the more likely something is to
            show up?
            So if we add a 2x fire multiplier plus a base weight of 10, we're still going to get very random results.
            You can imagine that every
            stratagem will have a weight of 10 and the fire stratagems will be a weight of 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that if you have a set of sliders that you like, you can fiddle with the base value to increase
            total randomness. It's literally just added onto the end of the calculation for weights.
        </p>
        <MudDivider/>
        <h3>Armour</h3>
        <p>
            Since Arrowhead provide armour in the super store, the tool does not distinguish between armour based on
            your warbond.
            Instead, it will randomly pick any passive. If you just don't own that type of armour, I recommend just
            picking something fun and different.
        </p>
        <MudDivider/>
        <h3>Daily Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            The daily challenge is a randomised loadout that is seeded and reset each UTC day. It's designed to be a fun
            challenge to get you into the game without
            having to think too hard about what you want to do. I encourage you to post your results on Reddit and share
            it with your friends :)
        </p>
        <MudDivider/>
        <h3>
            Warbonds and Player Names
        </h3>
        <p>
            You can select the warbonds that you own and the tool will attempt to save this against the player name in
            your local
            browser storage.
            So if you set up your warbonds for a player called, say, "John Helldiver", then when you visit again and
            type in that
            name onto the card, it will set the warbonds again for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can click into the name on each card to set it.
        </p>
